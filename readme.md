# THE WORLD IN 2050

Did you know that the world population increased from 1 billion in 1800 to around 8 billion today. And it’s still growing, even though the growth rate has declined from 2% per year around 50 years ago to approximatively 1% per year nowadays.

+ The aim of this project is going to use a Python script to estimate the growth of the world population over the next decades and to predict in which year, will the world population reach 10 billion.

+ The projection will be based on using a static growth rate of 1% per year. (In reality, currently this growth rate is declining slightly every year). We will also start our projections using an estimate of the world population of 7,850,000,000 in 2022.

- Considering a 1% population growth per year, we can use the following formula to estimate next year’s population:
    > next year population = current population x 1.01

+ Also the project was design to prompt the user to input his/her age to predict the coming years population and how old the user will be 

+ And finally the project is designed to tell by how much inhabitants will be in the world by 2050
